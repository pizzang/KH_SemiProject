                        1. I (hereafter referred to as 'Adopter') agree to adopt a companion animal (hereafter referred to as “Adopted Animal”) through PETMILY (hereafter referred to as the “Organization”) and provide the best environment and care of which I am capable as a responsible guardian until the natural death of the Adopted Animal. <br>
                        2. If the Adopted Animal is transferred, sold, stolen, or lost through the intentional or unintentional abuse or neglect by the Adopter or any relevant third parties, including family members, the Adopter agrees not to contest any civil or criminal penalties brought forth by the Organization. In the event that the Adopted Animal is transferred, sold, stolen, or lost, the Adopter agrees that the Adopter must notify the Organization immediately and cooperate fully to reclaim the Adopted Animal. <br>
                        3. The Adopter agrees to provide all necessary welfare for the Adopted Animal, including the provision of good quality feed and clean water, suitable and appropriate exercise, vaccination against diseases, and regular health checkups. <br>
                        4. Should the Adopted Animal fall ill, the Adopter will promptly arrange for veterinary treatment and provide other necessary care. If the Adopted Animal cannot be cured and its suffering is severe, the Adopter agrees not to act on their own accord but to notify and discuss alternative options with the Organization. The Adopter agrees to notify the Organization immediately even if the Adopted Animal dies of natural causes. <br>
                        5. The Adopted Animal must, at all times, wear a name badge which includes the contact information of the Adopter. Furthermore, the Adopter agrees to notify the Organization immediately of any changes in contact information or place of residence. <br>
                        6. For the purposes of the Organization monitoring the Adopted Animal, the Adopter agrees to receive calls and/or visits from the Organization, and to cooperate with requests for visits or photographs of the Adopted Animal. <br>
                        7. The Adopter agrees to the neutering policy of the Organization. If the Adopted Animal cannot be neutered prior to adoption, the Adopter will arrange for the Adopted Animal to be neutered as soon as the Adopted Animal is in good health and of an appropriate age for the surgery. The Adopter agrees to notify the Organization of the surgery. The Adopter agrees that the Adopted Animal will not be used for breeding under any circumstance prior to the surgery. <br>
                        8. Should the Adopter be unable to continue caring for the Adopted Animal for personal reasons, the Adopter will notify the Organization and will not arrange for re-adoption at their own discretion. Furthermore, the Adopter will not request a refund of the adoption fee. <br>
                        9. Should the Organization find that the care and environment provided to the Adopted Animal by the Adopter is unsuitable at any time after the adoption, the Adopter agrees to return the Adopted Animal to the Organization, and to cooperate fully without objections. <br>
